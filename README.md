# Project-OIR-Test1
This is an test app built for fun, OIR : Open Internet Radio is a personal project made for fun. The idea is same as my previous project SIR ( Simple Internet Radio )  

PS : one of the problems is that i didn't implement this in thread so it could not play as in background 
and one station con overlap other
